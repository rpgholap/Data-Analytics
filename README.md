## Key Topics Explored

### Decision Trees Overview
Machine learning involves building models that predict outcomes based on patterns in historical data. For example, predicting house prices based on characteristics like the number of bedrooms or lot size.

#### How Decision Trees Work:
- Divide data into groups based on features (e.g., bedrooms).
- Predict values derived from the average price within these groups.

#### Improving Decision Trees:
- Adding splits (deeper trees) captures more influencing factors like bathrooms, location, and lot size.
- Risk of overfitting with too many splits.

### Exploring Data with Pandas
- **Importing Pandas**:
  ```python
  import pandas as pd
  ```
- **Loading Data**:
  ```python
  melbourne_file_path = '../input/melbourne-housing-snapshot/melb_data.csv'
  melbourne_data = pd.read_csv(melbourne_file_path)
  ```
- **Summarizing Data**:
  ```python
  melbourne_data.describe()
  ```
  Insights include count, mean, standard deviation, min & max values, and percentiles.

### Building a Machine Learning Model
Steps to build and use a machine learning model:
1. **Select Target (y)**:
   ```python
   y = melbourne_data.Price
   ```
2. **Choose Features (X)**:
   ```python
   melbourne_features = ['Rooms', 'Bathroom', 'Landsize', 'Lattitude', 'Longtitude']
   X = melbourne_data[melbourne_features]
   ```
3. **Build the Model**:
   ```python
   from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor
   melbourne_model = DecisionTreeRegressor(random_state=1)
   melbourne_model.fit(X, y)
   ```
4. **Make Predictions**:
   ```python
   melbourne_model.predict(X.head())
   ```

### Model Validation
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**:
  ```python
  from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error
  mean_absolute_error(y, predicted_prices)
  ```
